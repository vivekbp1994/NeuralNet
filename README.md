# Hand Written Digit Recognition using Neural Network

The dataset consists of 1593 handwritten digits from around 80 persons were scanned, stretched in a rectangular box 16x16 in a gray scale of 256 values. Here neural network model is implemented using keras for imagine recognition.The model developed has an accuraccy of 93%.
